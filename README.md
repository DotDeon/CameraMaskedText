# Magic Text Effect

React Native Magic Text Effect
The React Native Magic Text Effect is a mobile application that allows users to create text that appears to change color based on the background behind your phone. The app uses a blurred camera view to mask the text and give the illusion of a changing color effect.

I saw a similar effect on Twitter and was fascinated by it, so I decided to create this app to replicate the effect.

Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:

Clone the app from the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/DotDeon/CameraMaskedText
Install dependencies: npm install
Run the app: expo start

You can update the text in App.js to anything you want to display on the screen
